# kanban-live

Basic drag and drop kanban board hosted on Apache Tomcat.

To host local:
Use create react app to creat a new react app and replace the src folder with the src folder from here.
Use yarn to download dependencies, then start the app using yarn start. 
The app should open in your default browser at localhost:3000
On the first page enter a title for a new board (the radio buttons currently do nothing) then hit enter, 
It should route you to an empty board with 3 columns
Use the fields in the top left to add cards, and add up to 7 extra columns

Only cards are draggable as of now.
